          Quantum holiday that day, no need to take leave to fetch him in

          report can his brain got bleeding. So cannot discharge first for
          further checkup. Imagine if didn't know this, need to fetch him back
          to hospital. Zero hospital bill: one night in emergency/ICU, ECG, CT
          scan, medicine, see specialist. If private, can be 5 figure bill.
          Maybe Wing Fai's connection waive this. Also his help to arrange
          that can directly go emergency. Otherwise might need to start from
          Klinik Kesihatan, then to specialist. With this visit, found his BP
          very high 198 / 122. Found out his old stroke and new stroke and
          minor bleeding in brain. When fetch him back, car remote key battery
          koyak. When reach home, cannot even to lock the car. Imagine the
          battery totally finished when I am in the hospital, very troublesome
          and costly.
