            Quantum holiday that day, no need to take leave to fetch him in
            hospital. When about the discharge him, suddenly got a CT scan
            report can his brain got bleeding. So cannot discharge first for
            further checkup. Imagine if didn't know this, need to fetch him back
            to hospital. Zero hospital bill: one night in emergency/ICU, ECG, CT
            scan, medicine, see specialist. If private, can be 5 figure bill.
            Maybe Wing Fai's connection waive this. Also his help to arrange
            that can directly go emergency. Otherwise might need to start from
            Klinik Kesihatan, then to specialist. With this visit, found his BP
            very high 198 / 122. Found out his old stroke and new stroke and
            minor bleeding in brain. When fetch him back, car remote key battery
            koyak. When reach home, cannot even to lock the car. Imagine the
            battery totally finished when I am in the hospital, very troublesome
            and costly.
